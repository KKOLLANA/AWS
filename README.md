Q33.  What is elastic ip in AWS?
An elastic IP address is a public static IPv4 address that is reachable from the Internet. Primarily, elastic IP addresses are managed by AWS to maintain its dynamic cloud computing services and within the AWS infrastructure, clients have virtual private clouds (VPC), and in the VPCs, users have instances. So while launching an EC2 instance, you obtain a public IP address by which that instance is reachable from the internet. Once you suspend that instance and restart the instance you get a different public IP for the same instance. So it's basically a difficulty to connect your instance from the internet for not having a static IP. To surmount this problem, an elastic IP is attached to an instance which doesn't switch after you stop/start the instance. To recapitulate, elastic IP is a permanent IP for the instance.

Q34.  What is fargate in AWS?
AWS (Amazon Web Service) fargate, a serverless compute engine for containers that operate with both Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) and makes it accessible to focus on building the applications. Fargate eliminates the need to provision and control servers, lets you designate and settle for resources per application, and enhances security through application isolation. Fargate designates the right amount of computing, eradicating the need to determine instances and scale cluster capability. It is required to pay for resources necessitated administering the containers, thereby reducing overprovisioning and paying for supplementary servers and drives each task or pod in its kernel implementing the responsibilities and pods its own remote compute environment. This allows your application to have workload isolation and revised security by design.

Q35.  What is cloudtrail AWS?
AWS CloudTrail, a service that facilitates governance, operational auditing, and risk auditing of AWS account and it can log, monitor, and retain account activity related to actions across AWS infrastructure. It provides a history of AWS account activity, including actions taken through the Management Console, SDKs, commandline tools, and other AWS services. This event history explains security analysis, resource change tracking, and troubleshooting and besides, you can use CloudTrail to identify unusual activity in AWS accounts. These capabilities help clarify operational analysis and troubleshooting.

Q36.  What is AWS Glue?
AWS Glue is a fully regulated extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that makes it easy for clients to store their data for analytics. It's possible to create and control an ETL job with few clicks in the Management Console, simply point AWS Glue to the data stored on AWS, and AWS Glue identifies data and stores the associated metadata in AWS Glue Data Catalog. Once cataloged, your data is instantly searchable, queryable, and available for ETL.
